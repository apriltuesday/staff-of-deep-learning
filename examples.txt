Staff of Safe Passage (Rare). You can use an action to peer into the mists of molten metal and speak one command word. You must use your reaction to break through the metal bands to gain access to the passage, provided that no creatures are inside.

Potion of Hearing allows you to hear spectral creatures as if you had great telepathy with them. In addition, you can also sense dark thoughts as if you had darkvision.

Amulet of Bad Faith (Rare). You gain a +1 bonus to Intelligence checks while this blackened amulet orbits your head. If you roll a Strength check to create the illusion, you are considered proficient with the instrument. You can dismiss the amulet as an action, ending the effect. Once the effect is removed, the amulet's magic is lost forever.

Amulet of Good Faith has the following random properties: appears in the favorific harbour, can be summoned any time, and it is attuned to you. It is immune to death effects. It is unaware that its companions are missing.

Soporific Blanket. This exquisite black robe is decorated with beanstalk patterns, embroidered with embroidered stumps and topped with a brassy cloud top. The robe has five buttons on the front and a three-way gate. The gate closes only when activated. It has a 6-inch radius and can’t be opened larger than that.

Scimitar of Silence (Very Rare). This tranquil scimitar contains a spectral nightmare that crams more evil into its tiny head. The scimitar requires no attunement by a spellcaster and gains the following additional properties: saps the wearer's senses and prevents the nightmare from waking up (save DC 17). If the nightmare leaves the scimitar, the scimitar returns to it. If the nightmare reappears, it appears and starts its own nightmare. The nightmare ends if it dies or is absorbed by another nightmare. The nightmare disappears after teleporting to a new body. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

Bag of Corpses. The bag contains all kinds of clothing, including armor and weapons. Saving Throws don't matter in the bag. Walls, ceilings, and floors don’t matter in the bag. Exploration, storage, and living areas don’t increase the contents of the bag. If you decide to break the bag, you must make a DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check (which uses your Intelligence modifier) to see if the objects in the bag can't hold their weight. As soon as the bag drops to 0 hit points, the GM decides what happens, but can use another round of GM discretion to determine the bag contents in the bag.

The Hagge Bagge can hold up to 24 pounds (not including the bag's contents) while unhinged. The bag looks like a snake with a slit for a tail. It sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. For 1 hour, the bag leaves a trail of glowing green and crimson fluid that turns translucent when it is opened. Creatures in the bag have disadvantage on saving throws made to escape the effects of the acid, sleep, or similar effects.

The Cursed Skull transforms into a sleet bird if the wielder attunes to the mace. This effect can occur only once every 60 days, but it can also occur every other day. When a creature attunes to the mace after it has spent the duration of its magic, the mace gradually loses its magic. The mace becomes an ordinary longsword that can be wielded as a medium sword (※Rare).

The Gardens of Babylon are a magical and magical world filled with music. The gardens are a sentient, chaotic, and good alignment centered on pure evil. The garden creatures can read and write Cuneiform, Cuneiform Common, and Cuneiform Kana. They have hearing and hearing/senses that allow them to speak Common, and they have a very good score. A garden creature can attack or block creatures it doesn't like, such as a creature with a good score.

Deep Learning Amulet of the Mind Fingers (Very Rare). This ancient artifact allows the GM to construct a device that allows the GM to mentally control the finger shapes and sizes of any sentient being within 10 feet of it. The finger shapes and sizes of the GM's choosing are determined by the GM's own personality and alignment.

Book of Tiny Evils and Evil News. A well-dressed man with modest clothes and a fine horn rings out in dragonkind. A fish is caught in the catch. A dragon appears. The catch is made on a moonless night and ends when all life in the world has decayed into no more than dust.
