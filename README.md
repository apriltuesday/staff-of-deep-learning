# Staff of Deep Learning

Generate D&D items using deep language models, because why the hell not.

> **Staff of Deep Learning** (Rare). This Staff of Deep Learning parses words quickly, allowing it to comprehend and write cryptic and/or jumbled messages as large as 20 feet long. If the staff succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check, the creature is charmed by the text and can speak its command word, even though its hearing is paltry.

## Model

The model is OpenAI's GPT-2 (117M), fine-tuned on D&D 5e magic item descriptions.

## Examples
